# Course Project (Getting & Cleaning Data Course)

This is a repo for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project.

The main file here is the script file <a href="https://github.com/sbiryukova/Course-Project-Getting-Cleaning-Data-/blob/master/run_analysis.R">run_analysis.R.</a><br>
The script works if the UCI HAR Dataset folder is unpacked into the working directory.<br>
The script does the following:
<ul><li type=hyphen>It merges the training and the test data into one data set.
Then it extracts the variables with the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
It takes the descriptive activity names and uses it to name the activities in the data set.
It labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
And, finally, it creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</ul>
