<h1>Work performed within the project</h1>
The work is based in the data collected within the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Project. The full data set and the data information are available at the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Machine Learning Repository Web Site</a>.<br>
Here the training and the test data sets were supplemented with the information about activities performed within each observation and performer's IDs.<br>
Then the two files were merged together and all the variables were labelled.<br>
After that only the means and standard deviations were subsetted on each measurment.<br>
Full names for ectivities as well as for variables were provided in the subset.<br>
Finally, means of the variables selected were calculated for all the observations grouped by activity type and subject.

<h1>Variables in the output file</h1>
The output file contains 68 variables.<br>
Two of them are grouping variables (SubjectID & Activity_Name).<br>
Other 66 variables are group means of means and standard deviations of different measurements.<br> 
Variable names provided in the file contain complete information on their meaning.
